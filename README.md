# Week 06 - Deep Learning - Day 2 - Playground Part II

This exercise uses the TensorFlow playground as a tool to visually check how different hyperparameters of neural networks impact the convergence of the algorithm.

This visualization is intended to help you translate the neural network you define in Playground into code, using the Keras library.
